# Copolymer-classical-topology-generator-
Generates GROMACS topology and parameter files for mixed random copolymer systems containing two types of monomers (tested for N2200 alkylated and glycolated polymer chains, modeling P10 to P90 chains).

1. Input the information about the two polymers inlcuding DFT calculated potentials
   example inputs are provided, which is the N2200 monomer and it's glycolated chain versions
3. Define the polymer experimental information (Mn, Mw, PDI)
4. Generate polymer distributions

Detailed info with diagrams provided in the jupyter notebook
